//#-->pre processr directive
//include-->input output stream(header file)
//stream-->flow of data
//two ways--><iostream>
//namespace--> it  is a scope (area) where we define our identifier.
//namespace--> here all the identifier related to standard libarary is present.
//application of conflict the program
//main()-->our program execution begines from the main it must return int,(should be 0).
//return 0--> it is a stacial massege for ours os that,our program execution is successful.
//we should define function with proper name and a parenthesis in parenthesis,we may pass some parameters.
//{}-->function boundary define
//cin>>Extration oprator .object ->iostream.
//cout<<insertion oprator. object->ostream.
//variable:in variable we store our data, for further processing ,it just like a container which can contain a value.
//data type:we have many representation of data,soin c++ we have to mention the data type of our varibale as well (static typed lang)
//ex;int=4 byte,float=4 byte,double=8 byte,char=1 byte,string=run time
//token:it is smallest unit of code which has some meaning to compiler.
//cout<<"welcome";-->4 token
//int a,b,c;-->7token

//category
//===========
//1) identifier
//2)kewords
//3)leterals
//4)constant
//5)string
//6)special symbol/delimeter
//7)operator



//1)identifier-main()->unique identifier-->variables,fun,class

//5 rules:naming convention

//1)first character should always be alphabet(A-Z)(a-z) and underscore()ex->a__56
//2)rest character:alphabet+underscore+numeric(0-9)
//3)no white space in between
//4)no keyword is allow is to use as a identifier
//5)the name should be relevent to context(healthy coding)


//keword-->it is spacial reserved pre defined words.
//ex->auto,for,while,if,else,true,false,etc



//what is string->>to display content,masseges,output,-->string//sequece of charcater
//charcter set-->A-Z
//a-z
//0-9

//what is special symbol:set interface/boundary between component of program
//ex; {},(),[],=,/,...


//operator-->it is special symbols,used to perform some operation.every operator has a predefined
//code ,with,the,help of that,it perform any operation.
//ex-> 45+3=48;
//cascading means-->one by one that means add two statement
